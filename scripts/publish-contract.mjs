/**
 * Publish loupe-web's consumer contract to the backend, which verifies it in CI.
 *
 * THE POINT. `npm run generate:api-types` pulls types FROM the backend, so the
 * app learns about changes only when someone remembers to re-run it — and the
 * backend never learns anything about us at all. It can delete an endpoint this
 * app calls and its build stays green. This runs the other way: it hands the
 * backend a list of what we depend on, and the backend's CI fails if it stops
 * providing any of it.
 *
 * WHY A FILE AND NOT A PACT BROKER. A broker is a service that stores contracts
 * and answers "can I deploy". With one API and two clients owned by one person,
 * git already stores versioned artifacts and CI already blocks bad merges, so a
 * broker would be infrastructure to host and keep alive for coordination that
 * does not exist yet. If a second team ever owns a consumer, that is the moment
 * this file becomes a `pact-broker publish` call and not before.
 *
 * THE ROT PROBLEM, AND WHAT IS DONE ABOUT IT. A hand-maintained contract slowly
 * stops describing the app: someone adds a call and never adds a contract entry,
 * so the backend can break it freely and the check still passes green. This
 * script therefore refuses to publish silently while that is true — it scans the
 * source for endpoint literals and reports any that the contract does not
 * declare. --strict turns that report into a failure, which is what CI runs.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/publish-contract.mjs            # publish, warn about drift
 *   node scripts/publish-contract.mjs --strict   # fail on drift (CI)
 *   node scripts/publish-contract.mjs --check    # verify only, write nothing
